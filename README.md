# spotify-liked-list-workaround
I refuse to update my Spotify app on Android since they just love breaking things that I use for no reason at all. This set of scripts circumvents the fact that they just flat-out broke the Liked Songs list that I liked to shuffle.

The set of scripts currently authenticates, then gets a list of the songs I've liked, then adds those songs to a specified existing playlist.

## To do
- improve authentication stuff
- have it create a new playlist instead of having to do that manually first
- merge things into one script
- ideally make this available for the world
- somehow make Spotify go bankrupt to fix their monopoly
